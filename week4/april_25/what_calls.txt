What happened to the funciton calls. Because there was no need to spill, 
the optimized functions only needed to call the values in the registers 
and manipulate them there. Because of that, there was no need for unnessasary 
code to spill to the stack. As for the 10*10 function, the machine seems 
to have manually calculated this and produces 100 for the answer. That 
is very effecient.

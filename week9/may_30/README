Fact is clearly not tail recursive because the code itself jumps up one block 
based on jump no equal. When the condition is not met, the function ends and the
integer is returned.

fact2 is tail recursive becuase it copies the tail factrep and puts it into its
code and that serves as it's tail even though it doesn't jump to that code directly.

Path2 is very similar to path 1. we take the two arguments and create a cmp that puts the result in the flag register. The program is smart enough to know that there are only two returnable answers. So it stores the 'else' answer into the return value. If the condition is met however, then the return value is saved into the return register instead of the common 'else' return that was previously in there. Yet, because there is a print statement in the 'if' condition, there is a bit more work to do. For example there is an xor in the program that is used to 0 out the register eax itself. Also, we make a call to the printf if the condition is true. Else the return value is just the saved 'else' value.

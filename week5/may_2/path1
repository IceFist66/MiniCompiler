In path1, we take the two arguments and create a cmp that puts the result in the
flag register. The program is smart enough to know that there are only two 
answers. So it stores the 'else' answer into the return value. If the condition
is met however, then the return value is saved into the return register instead 
of the common 'else' return that was previously in there.
